# TGSS - TeleGram Session Stealer (Core Exploit)
# About :
This is an exploit for stealing telegram sessions and also bypass Two Factor Authentication (2FA) on windows operation systems.

# Attention :
It was a long time ago that this method was used by me and when I expressed this method in a group related to the Parsing Security Team 
in the telegram environment, unfortunately, the directors of that team made an immoral and unprofessional work. 
They produced a tool and made it into the name of their team, without inserting my name. 
I now put the main code for this exploit, which all the software made for this purpose follow this method.
It's natural that when it comes to the technique of making a technique, then it's no longer hard to make a tool for it and it's easy to do. 
But it is very good if we respect and do not abuse each other.
